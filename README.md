# Simple Flight Simulator

This project is a simple WebGL rendering engine for generating and rendering a 3D terrain model. The user can "fly" over the terrain by manipulating the camera view using the arrow keys. The project uses WebGL 2.0 and GLSL 3.00 ES for rendering.

## Features

- **WebGL Rendering Engine**: Utilized WebGL 2.0 and GLSL 3.00 ES for rendering a 3D terrain model.
- **Terrain Generation**: Generated a flat grid of triangles and shapes it into a unique terrain.
- **Phong Shading**: Implemented Phong shading for realistic lighting effects, including ambient, diffuse, and specular components.
- **Fog Effect**: Added a fog effect to the scene for enhanced visual depth.
- **Camera Control**: Allow users to control the camera orientation and speed using keyboard inputs.

## Tools and Technologies
- **WebGL 2.0**: For rendering 3D graphics
- **GLSL 3.00 ES**: For writing vertex and fragment shaders
- **JavaScript**: Main programming language for the project
- **glMatrix**: Library for high-performance matrix and vector operations
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page and embedding the WebGL canvas
